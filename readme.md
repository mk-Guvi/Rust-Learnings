### Rust Commands Overview

1. **Compile a Rust file**:  
   `rustc main.rs`

2. **Run the compiled file on macOS/Linux**:  
   `./main.rs`

3. **Format Rust files**:  
   `rustfmt main.rs`

4. **Create a new Cargo project**:  
   `cargo new hello_cargo`  
   This creates a folder named `hello_cargo` with a basic Cargo setup. All Rust source files should be placed under the `src` directory.

5. **Build the project**:  
   `cargo build`  
   This command creates executable files in the `./target/debug/hello_cargo` directory.

6. **Compile and run the project**:  
   `cargo run`  
   This will compile the code (if necessary) and run the resulting executable from `./target/debug/hello_cargo`.

7. **Check the code for errors**:  
   `cargo check`  
   This command checks the code and reports any errors without producing an executable, making it faster than a full build.

8. **Build an optimized release version**:  
   `cargo build --release`  
   This will create optimized executables in the `./target/release` directory. Since this process takes more time than a standard build, it's typically used for production, while `cargo build` is preferred for development.

9. **Add rand Crate**:
   `cargo add rand`
   This will add rand crate.

10. **Add rand Crate**:
   `cargo doc --open`
   This opens the docs of all the crates used.
### Notes:

- **Macros**:  
  In Rust, using `!` indicates a macro, not a function.  
  Example: `println!("Hello, world!")` is a macro.

- **Standalone Executables**:  
  Rust-generated executable files can run on systems without Rust installed, unlike some other languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript), which require their respective runtime environments.

- **Prelude**:  
  Rust provides a set of commonly used methods and traits that are available in the global scope by default. This collection is known as the Prelude. For example, the `String::new` method is part of the Prelude.

- **Crates**:  
  Crates are collections of Rust code. There are two types of crates: binary crates and library crates. Binary crates can be executed directly, while library crates are meant to be integrated into projects but cannot be executed on their own.

- **Semantic Versions**:
   Rust crates use semantic versioning. For example, in version 0.8.6, the 0 refers to the major version, indicating changes that might remove old functionalities. The 8 refers to the minor version, representing updates that add new features without breaking existing functionality. The 6 refers to the patch version, which addresses bug fixes.  


- **Shadowing Variables**:  
   In Rust, you can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous one, with the second declaration "shadowing" the first. This means the compiler only recognizes the most recent version of the variable. Shadowing allows you to reference the original value in the new variable. A common use case is making a variable immutable after performing some operations. Unlike with `mut`, shadowing allows you to change the type of the value. This behavior is demonstrated in the guessing game program.  
   
   Example: `let a = 2; let a = a + 2; println!("a value is {a}");` // Outputs 4.  
   
   Although you could achieve a similar result by using different variable names (e.g., `let a = 2; let a_readonly = a;`), this can create confusion over which variable to use. Shadowing provides a cleaner and more efficient solution.


### Scalar Types in Rust

   In Rust, a **scalar type** represents a single value. Rust provides four primary scalar types:

   1. **Integer**
   2. **Floating Point Numbers**
   3. **Booleans**
   4. **Characters**

   #### 1. Integer
      An integer is a number without decimal points. There are two kinds of integers in Rust:

      - **Signed integers (`i32`)**: These store both positive and negative values. Rust uses 2's complement representation, meaning if the first bit is 0, the number is negative; otherwise, it's positive. The range for signed integers is `-(2^(n-1))` to `2^(n-1) - 1`, where `n` is the number of bits (e.g., for `i8`, the range is `-128` to `127`).
      
      - **Unsigned integers (`u32`)**: These store only positive values, from `0` to `2^n - 1` (e.g., `u8` ranges from `0` to `255`).

      Types of integers:
      - `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize` (signed integers)
      - `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize` (unsigned integers)

      For example, `i8` can hold values from `-128` to `127`. You can specify integer types using a suffix, such as `28u8`. Rust allows the use of underscores as visual separators for readability, like `1_000_000`.

      ##### Integer Literals:
      - **Decimal**: `10_000`
      - **Hexadecimal**: `0xff`
      - **Octal**: `0o77`
      - **Binary**: `0b1111_0000`
      - **Byte (`u8` only)**: `b'A'`

      #### Handling Integer Overflow
      Rust provides several methods to handle integer overflow, especially in **debug mode**:

      - **`wrapping_add()`**: Wraps around on overflow.
      ```rust
      let b: u8 = random_number().wrapping_add(200);
      println!("b is {b}");
      ```

      - **`overflowing_add()`**: Returns a tuple where the second value is a `bool` indicating whether an overflow occurred.
      ```rust
      let (d, h): (u8, bool) = random_number().overflowing_add(200);
      println!("D is {d}, H is {h}");
      ```

      - **`checked_add()`**: Returns `None` if the addition would overflow.
      ```rust
      let c = match random_number().checked_add(200) {
            Some(num) => num,
            None => {
               println!("Cannot add number");
               return;
            }
      };
      println!("C is {c}");
      ```

      This allows safe and predictable behavior when working with integer operations.
   
   #### 2. **Floating-Point Types**

      Rust supports two floating-point types: `f32` and `f64`, with `f64` being the default. All floating-point numbers in Rust are signed, meaning they can represent both positive and negative values.

      - **`f32`**: Single precision (32 bits)
      - **`f64`**: Double precision (64 bits)

   #### 3. **Numeric Operations**

      Rust provides all the basic arithmetic operations:

      - **Addition** (`+`)
      - **Subtraction** (`-`)
      - **Multiplication** (`*`)
      - **Division** (`/`)
      - **Remainder** (`%`)

      For division, if both operands are integers, the result will be an integer as well, and any decimal part will be truncated. If you need the result to include the decimal portion, you must specify floating-point types. For example:

      ```rust
      let a = 5 / 2;        // Result: 2 (integer division)
      let b: f32 = 5_f32 / 2_f32;  // Result: 2.5 (floating-point division)
      ```

   #### 4. **Boolean Type**

      Rust's boolean type represents a value that can be either `true` or `false`. It is typically used in conditional statements and logic operations.
   
   #### 5. **Character Type**

      In Rust, strings are enclosed in double quotes, whereas characters use single quotes. Rust's `char` type represents a single Unicode scalar value. It is 4 bytes in size and can represent a wide range of characters, including letters, numbers, and various special symbols.

      **Example:**

      ```rust
      let c = 'A';
      let heart = '‚ù§';
      let smiley = 'üòä';
      ```

### Compound Types in Rust

   Compound types allow grouping multiple values into a single type. Rust provides two primitive compound types: **tuples** and **arrays**.

   #### 1. Tuples

   Tuples can store multiple values of different types, and their length is fixed. A special tuple with no values is called a "unit."

   #### 2. Arrays

   Arrays store multiple values of the same type and are also of fixed length in Rust.

   **Examples:**

   ```rust
   let a = [1, 2, 3];
   let b: [u32; 3] = [2, 3, 4];    // Array of 3 u32 elements
   let c = [10; 5];    // Creates an array with 5 elements, all initialized to 10
   ```

   Accessing an index that is out of bounds will result in a **runtime error**. While the code will compile successfully, an error will be thrown if you attempt to access an invalid index during execution.
